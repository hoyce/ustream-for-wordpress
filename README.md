Ustream for WordPress is a plugin that enables the user to add tags (short codes) on the format [ustream cid="xxxxx"] or [ustream vid="xxxxx"] in blog posts/pages and have them replaced by their video content from UStream.

This really comes in handy when your blog is on a multi site WordPress instance where you are not allowed to add iframe code etc.

This plugin uses short codes and automatically replaces the [ustream cid="xxxxx"] or [ustream vid="xxxxx"] tags with the embeded video related to the given cid or vid.

The [ustream cid="xxxxx"] tag is used when you want to stream a live broad cast and the [ustream vid="xxxxx"] is used when to publish a recorded video.
