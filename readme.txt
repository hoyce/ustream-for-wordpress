== Description ==

Ustream for WordPress is a plugin that enables the user to embed Ustream live and recorded embeds. Put the url for the ustream video you'd like between the embed tags.

This really comes in handy when your blog is on a multi site WordPress instance where you are not allowed to add iframe code etc.

### Deprecated shortcode embed method

The deprecated method for embedding Ustream still works, but ignores all non-oembed info. One can add tags (short codes) on the format `[ustream cid="xxxxx"]` or `[ustream vid="xxxxx"]` in blog posts/pages and have them replaced by their video content from UStream.

This deprecated method uses short codes and automatically replaces the [ustream cid="xxxxx"] or [ustream vid="xxxxx"] tags with the embedded video related to the given cid or vid.

The [ustream cid="xxxxx"] tag is used when you want to stream a live broad cast and the [ustream vid="xxxxx"] is used when to publish a recorded video.
